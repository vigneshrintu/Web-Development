->We have organised the routes definiation in another dir called routes and made a file
student.js which has all the routes defined init.
->Then exported them at the end of the student.js file.
->Then imported them in our main js file and used them via middleware function app.use() so now 
we donot have to do anything now whenever the client enters the route in his browser then those routes
that we have defined will redirect him and sends respective route response.
