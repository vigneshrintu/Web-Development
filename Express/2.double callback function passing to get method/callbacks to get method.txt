->You can pass mutliple callback function to the get method or even a single callback function or even no callback
function at all.
->But to pass dual or morethan dual callback functions to the get method,we need to use arrow functions and separate
them via comma.
->We can even pass an array of callback functions to the get method so that one gets executed after another in a sequence.
->We can only send one response at a time to the client so we must use res.send("some respone")
in the last callback function only and above functions which gets executed before the last back functions must
have next as a parameter in them and next() must be invoked inside them except for the last method.
->next() tells a function that it needs to call another callback function beside it or below it.
->If you donot use next attribute and next() then only that particular function will gets executed and 
rest of the callback functions wont get executed and same goes to a function which sends response then rest
of the functions below it wont get executed.
