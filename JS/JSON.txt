JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

- JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.
- It stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
- It is text-based and human-readable.
- It is easy to parse and generate data in JSON format.
- JSON is language-independent, meaning it can be used with any programming language.
- JSON is often used for transmitting data between a server and a web application.
- JSON syntax is a subset of JavaScript object literal notation, but it's more restricted.
- JSON data consists of key-value pairs, similar to JavaScript objects.
- Keys must be surrounded by double quotes, and only simple data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects are allowed.
- Example of JSON data:
    {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York",
        "isStudent": true,
        "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "coding"],
        "address": {
            "street": "123 Main St",
            "city": "Anytown",
            "zip": "12345"
        }
    }
- JSON is widely used in web development for exchanging data between client and server applications.
